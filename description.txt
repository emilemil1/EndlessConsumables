== How To Use ==

- When a consumable item is fully stacked it will turn Endless. Endless items are not consumed when used.

- Endless buff potions will automatically be reused when their buff expires. This requires that the potion is either in your inventory or portable storage. Mod potions may require the "/endless [potion name]" command to work.

== About ==
