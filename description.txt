== How To Use ==

- When a consumable item is fully stacked it will turn Endless. Endless items are not consumed when used. Manually splitting the stack will revert it.

- Endless buff potions will automatically be reused when their buff expires. This requires that the potion is either in your inventory or portable storage (except Void Vault). Mod potions may require the "/endless [potion name]" command to work.

== About ==

This mod is inspired by the True Endless mod.
