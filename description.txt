== Description ==

Simply reach maximum stacks and your item will be marked as "(endless)", at which point it will no longer consume stacks when used.

Additionally any endless buff potions will be automatically refreshed, as long as the potion is either in your inventory or portable storage (except Void Vault).

More detailed documentation is available at the GitHub page, including ways to get around certain mod consumables not working.
